 BattleShip Game - Problem Statement
You are to design and implement a 2-player BattleShip game, where both players fire missiles at each other's ships until one player loses all their ships.

🧩 Game Setup
1. Battlefield
A square grid of size NxN.

The battlefield is divided equally:

Left half (first N/2 columns): belongs to PlayerA

Right half (last N/2 columns): belongs to PlayerB

2. Ships
Ships are square-shaped blocks of size x size.

Ships are stationary (they do not move).

No two ships can overlap, but they can touch.

Each ship is placed with its top-left corner coordinates.

Same ship ID will have a ship for each player (i.e., added to both sides).

Ship placement is done via:

scss
Copy
Edit
addShip(id, size, xA, yA, xB, yB)
🎮 Gameplay Rules
Game is started by startGame() method.

Players take turns (starting with PlayerA) to fire missiles at random coordinates on the opponent’s side.

A missile:

Hits if it lands inside any ship’s area → remove that part.

Misses if it hits empty space.

A ship is destroyed when all its occupied cells are hit.

No duplicate coordinates are allowed (missiles must not be fired at the same coordinate again).

🏁 Game Over
A player loses if all their ships are destroyed.

The other player is declared the winner.
